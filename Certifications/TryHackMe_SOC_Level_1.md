## 🚀 Why It Matters

Earning SOC L1 validates that I can:

1. Triage and investigate security alerts quickly and accurately.  
2. Distill noisy telemetry into meaningful threat intelligence.  
3. Communicate findings to both technical and non‑technical stakeholders.  

It also sets the stage for future blue‑team certifications like CompTIA CySA+, GCIA, and GCED.
